# L1InfoProjet1

## This project is my first real software development project and was part of an introductory course to software development with the University of Nantes, France.

### This software is based on Javascript using the algoscript.info web based IDE.
### The fact that using algoscript.info was mandatory to pass that course resulted in a messy code to align with the library of functions named in French.
### So it's messy for many reasons, I do not recommend anyone to view this code nor try to understand it as it would burn your retina in a single line of code and you would not be able to recover.
### Though if you still want to play the game here are a few instructions for you to do so.

## How to play : 

### - Open the website algoscript.info
### - Copy paste in the *Code JS* section the whole piece of code provided in the git.
### - Go to *File Manager* -> *External FS* -> load in the 2 provided files that are in this git apart from the main and the README.
### - Go back to graphic output.
### - Click the blue icon on the top left that is meant as a *RUN* visual node.
### - There is one chance out of 45 that you'll be able to play this game.

## How to fix the bugs :

### Change computer, I'm not kidding, what did you expect from my first ever software written on that abomination that is algoscript ?
